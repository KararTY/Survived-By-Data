"string20461": "We didn't stand a chance when the Chimera came. We've had too many generations of peace. The deserts of the Cinder Valley are the only lingering scars of the last time we were at war.",
"string20462": "Farming, crafting and diplomacy; those were the ancestral legacies we were passing to our children. They won't help us now.",

"string20466": "The Fury and their Chimera minions pushed us to the Tower, but we did not break. Perhaps now we can finally go on the offensive.",
"string20467": "The Chimera and the shuddering of the World Tree, they must be connected.  Those abominations were unknown before that first great quake that tore enormous fissures into the Heartland.",
"string20468": "To the West only slivers of land remain, to the South the great deserts of the Cinder Valley still fester, and to the North and East come the Chimera.  We are surrounded on all sides by death.",
"string20469": "If only pilgrimage up the World Tree was possible. But the madness that rises from the roots of the tree would consume up before we could ascend to another terrace.",
"string20470": "That the Fury seek to wipe us out is now clear, but are the tremors of the World Tree their doing or what drives them to hate us?",
"string20471": "The destruction of the Hydra and the Locus have bought us both time and information, but do not think that we do not still stand on the edge of a precipice.",
"string20472": "Pilgrimage... it was a fool's thought. This is our home, our only home. We have no choice but to fight back.",
"string20473": "I know we cannot ignore the Chimera, but we can only defeat the Chimera once we understand why they are attacking us.",
"string20474": "So many mysteries remain. Why have the Spirits turned rabid? Why have the Infernals not risen up to burn away the Chimera and the Fury?",
"string20475": "Though the Chimera come at us from the North and the East, this started in the West, the epicenter of the first great quake. Do answers lie hidden amidst that devastated landscape?",
"string20476": "We have managed to save a few records in our frantic retreat. I cannot wage war like you can, but I can seek the answers that might arm you.",
"string20477": "Before the war, not all of the insane gathered here at the Tower. Some, perhaps those of stronger will than the others, migrated to the deep valleys to the West.",

But there are old stories of a type of Infernal that resembles a giant squid that has a leathery hide so it can survive underwater. Turns out that same hide makes it vulnerable to the fouled resin. That means we have an Infernal Chimeric Kraken on our hands. Go kill it.",

The Leo Magi seem the most intelligent of the lot, and the most likely to form complex social structures. Start killing them and see if there are any signs of organization.",

What I want you to do is get close to one (or three) and see if it provides any clues for tracking this hero of theirs down. I don't expect the Leos to take kindly to your presence, so expect some resistance as you try to learn what you can from the things. ",

You're a champion for supporting the development of Survived By at the highest level, and you're sure to become a champion of the Heartlands.\n\nYour new Trail of Thorns attachment will leave a path of destruction and awe in your wake, as your comrades marvel at the Bloodthorn Parasite on your back. Should you fall in battle (and you will) a Bloodthorn gravestone will be erected in your honor. Even death cannot rob you of your new Choker of Thorns or Circle of Thorns, which has lifetime insurance.\n\nMay your wits be sharper than the Thorns you wear into battle.\n\n        - The Survived By Team",
